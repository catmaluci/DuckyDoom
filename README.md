# 🎯 Project: DuckyDoom - Classic Carnival Games
Welcome to the development repository for DuckyDoom, an interactive online game platform! In this project, we're building a dynamic and animated web page as part of a new line of classic carnival games, specifically under the "Fair Games" category. Our team is particularly focused on developing the "Target Practice" game.

## 📝 Project Description
This project aims to create an interactive and engaging web page for the Target Practice game. The game is designed to be dynamic and animated, providing an attractive experience for users. We've incorporated a creative design and interactive behavior suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.

## ✨ Key Features
* Name Input: Users can enter their name, which will be displayed on the main page, personalizing their experience.

* Aiming Sight: The game will feature a crosshair or aiming sight to target objects.

* Targets/Objects: Users can knock down one or more objects as part of the gameplay.

* Animations: Targets will move with engaging animations to make the game more entertaining and challenging.

* Alerts: Upon hitting a target, the game will notify the user with a visual alert.

* Timer: A countdown timer will be displayed to add dynamism and a time limit to the game.

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

## 💻 Technologies Used
* Front-end: HTML, CSS (SASS), JavaScript (Vanilla)

* Design: Figma (for prototypes and wireframes)

* Version Control: Git with GitFlow workflow

* Responsiveness: Mobile-first approach, ensuring optimal display on both mobile and desktop devices.

Code Principles:

* Semantic HTML for clear structure.

* Reusable CSS for maintainability.

* Modular code in both CSS and JavaScript for better organization.

## 📋 Development Requirements
* Clean Code: The code must be readable, well-structured, and easy to maintain.

Documentation:

* Detailed Wireframes and Mockups.

* Interactive Figma Prototype.

* Flowcharts for game algorithms.

* User Stories and Product Backlog (with estimates).

* Kanban board for project management and Sprint Backlog.

## 🎨 UX/UI Requirements
The design must be creative, interactive, and entertaining to offer a unique user experience. The game needs to be user-friendly, intuitive, and visually appealing, utilizing animations and transitions to keep players engaged.

## 🗓️ Development Process
Development is conducted in agile iterations. Our team utilizes a Kanban approach for task management and a Sprint Backlog for planning iterations. User Stories are defined for each significant game functionality and are assigned with their respective estimates.

## 🗺️ Roadmap
🔹 Phase 1: Design and Planning 💡
Complete wireframes, mockups, and Figma prototypes.

Establish the GitFlow workflow and configure the repository.

🔹 Phase 2: Game Development 🕹️
Implement basic game functionality (player name input, timer, aiming sight, and targets).

Create animations for the targets/objects.

Develop alerts to notify the user when they hit a target.

🔹 Phase 3: Styling and UX/UI Design 🎨✨
